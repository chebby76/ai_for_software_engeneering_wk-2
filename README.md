# 🧠 Mental Health Data Analysis with ML  
> Empowering insights through data, one thought at a time. 🌱

---

## 📂 Project Overview
This project explores mental health survey data and uses machine learning to uncover patterns, trends, and potential predictive insights. Built entirely in **Jupyter Notebook**, it's designed for accessibility, collaboration, and clarity.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🧹 Clean and preprocess a large mental health dataset  
- 📊 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- 🤖 Train and evaluate machine learning models for prediction  
- 🧠 Reflect on ethical implications and real-world relevance
